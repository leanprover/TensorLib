Shapes and strides in tensors are represented as lists, where the length of the
list is the number of dimensions. For example, a 2 x 3 matrix has a shape of [2, 3].

```
>>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
>>> x
array([[0, 1, 2],
       [3, 4, 5]])
>>> x.shape
(2, 3)
```

(See https://web.mit.edu/dvp/Public/numpybook.pdf for extensive discussion of shape and stride.)

What about the unit element? What is the shape of an empty tensor? For example,
what is the shape of the 1D empty array `[]`? We follow NumPy by defining the shape
as a 1d matrix with 0 elements.

```
>>> np.array([]).shape
(0,)
```

(Assuming we allow 0s in other dimensions, we can shape-check the empty tensor at other shapes, e.g.
`np.array([]).reshape([1,2,3,0,5])` succeeds.)

The only way to have an empty shape in Numpy is as a "scalar array" (or "array scalar" depending on the document.)

    https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html

A scalar array is conceptually a boxed scalar with an empty shape

```
>>> np.array(1).shape
()
```

`None` also yields an empty shape, but we ignore this case.

```
>>> np.array(None).shape
()
```

Strides also are empty for scalar arrays.

```
>>> np.array(1).strides
()
```

Shape is independent of the size of the dtype.

Strides can be computed from the shape by figuring out how many elements you
need to jump over to get to the next spot and mulitplying by the bytes in each
element.

A given shape can have different strides if the tensor is a view of another
tensor. For example, in a square matrix, the transposed matrix view has the same
shape but the strides change.

Broadcasting does funny things to strides, e.g. the stride can be 0 on a dimension,
so this is just the default case.
